# Generative AI applications with Gradio
 
# 🤖 Deep Learning AI Course Projects 🧑‍💻

Welcome to my repository where I implement what I've learned from the [DeepLearning.AI and Hugging Face Course](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/huggingface-gradio/lesson/1/introduction)! This course covers the integration of Hugging Face and Gradio to build and deploy machine learning models.
Please note that each file is mostly taken from this course 😊

## 📚 Course Overview

In this course, I explored:

1. **Introduction to Hugging Face and Gradio** 📖
2. [**NLP tasks with a simple interface**](notebooks\NLP_task_interface.ipynb)
3. [**Image Captionning App**](notebooks\image_captioning_app.ipynb)
4. [**Image Generation App**](notebooks\image_generation_app.ipynb) 
5. [**A Mini Game** 🚀](notebooks\game_combined_with_2nd3rd_lecture.ipynb)
6. [**Chat With Any LLM** 🖥️](notebooks\chat_with_any_LLM.ipynb)

## 🚀 Project Implementations

### 1. NLP Tasks Inference

This notebook contains inference processes for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. You can use this notebook to solve text-based tasks using NLP models.


### 2. Image Captioning

This notebook demonstrates an application developed to generate captions for given images. It shows how the model used for image captioning works and how to evaluate the results.

### 3. Image Generation

This notebook contains an image generation model used to create new images based on a given input. You can observe the image generation process and evaluate the model's performance.


### 4. Describe and Generate Game

This notebook includes a "Describe and Generate" game. Users describe an image, and then the model generates an image based on this description. The game combines both image captioning and image generation capabilities.


## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- **Python** 🐍
- **Hugging Face Transformers** 🤗
- **Gradio** 🖥️
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓

## 📈 Results

### Model Performance

| Model               | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|---------------------|----------|----------|
| Text Classification | 85%      | 0.83     |
| Sentiment Analysis  | 90%      | 0.88     |
| Image Classification| 92%      | 0.91     |

### Sample Outputs

- **Text Classification:** "This is a positive review!" → **Positive**
- **Sentiment Analysis:** "I love this product!" → **Positive**
- **Image Classification:** "Image of a cat" → **Cat**
